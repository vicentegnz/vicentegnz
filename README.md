### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Vicente Gonz√°lez!

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in C#, .Net and Azure, especially in distributed systems and backend processes, always with preference for using good practices and with SOLID principles in mind.

Passionate about learning new things through colleagues, talks, blogs, and pet projects.

Here you will find some of my personal projects, from some made when I was a student to some pet projects in order to test different technologies.

I have created a personal organization [VicenteGnz-Contributions](https://github.com/vicentegnz-contributions)
 to keep organized all the open-source projects that interest me, where I have collaborated or I intend to do it.
